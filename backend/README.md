# Keycloak User Management Service
The Keycloak User Management Service functions as an API service layer for the Keycloak User Management application. 

The Keycloak APIs do not offer the level of fine-grained security needed to restrict users' access, allowing them to modify just their assigned Client ID's configuration information. To mitigate this potential risk, we propose creating Custom Service API that can restrict access to the underlying Keycloak APIs.
In some cases the Keycloak API’s are also limited in their ability to provide fine grained searching and filtering of data.

The Service API is meant to extend capabilities beyond what’s offered directly by Keycloak.
